# AutoHotkey Scripts

My janky scripts for improved eFFiCieNcY. You can download AHK here - https://www.autohotkey.com/


## Main Script `ax_main.ahk`

This is the script that calls other sub-scripts and contains the most important hotkeys.

If you decide to try it, you might want to remove this line - `#Include X:\Aeraglyx\secret.ahk`. It just points to my private script.

Some of the functionality:
- Easier tab navigation (Chrome, VS Code)
- Quick Spotify search
- Â± 40 volume for switching between headphones and speakers
- Night light switch
- `Ctrl`+`Z` and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Z` in Chrome
- Hotkeys for AE, LaTeX
- Hotkeys for favourite websites
- Etc.


## Colour Picker

W.I.P.


## EN/CS Hybrid Keyboard Layout `en_cs_hybrid.ahk`

My custom keyboard layout that combines the default EN layout with Czech characters. This gets activated from the main script with `Alt` + `Shift`, similar to how you'd normally switch layouts.

Irreplacable for people like me who are used to the mainstream layout but live in Czech Republic ðŸ™ƒ

However, it can do some weird stuff to other hotkeys because it changes numbers to the CS characters, so enable it only when you need it.


## Scroll Wheel Acceleration `acc_scroll.ahk`

Similar to `acc_mouse.ahk` but for scroll wheel. Makes scrolling way faster and easier.


## Mouse Acceleration `acc_mouse.ahk`

This makes it easier to navigate using mouse. Slow mouse movement remains the same, fast movement gets even faster. A bit buggy and unreliable though.
