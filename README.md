# AutoHotkey Scripts

My janky scripts for improved eFFiCieNcY. You can download AHK here - https://www.autohotkey.com/


## Main Script `ax_main.ahk`

This is the script that calls other sub-scripts and contains the most important hotkeys.

If you decide to try it, you might want to remove this line - `#Include X:\Aeraglyx\secret.ahk`. It just points to my private script.

Some of the functionality:
- Easier tab navigation (Chrome, VS Code)
- Quick search on Spotify & Wolfram Alpha
- Â± 40 volume for switching between headphones and speakers
- Night light switch
- `Ctrl`+`Z` and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Z` in Chrome
- Hotkeys for AE, LaTeX, Python
- Hotkeys for favourite websites
- Etc.


## Blender Colour Picker

Colour checker/picker that can "see" through Filmic in Blender. While running, `Ctrl`+`C` copies the data so you can paste it in any Blender colour input.


## EN/CS Hybrid Keyboard Layout `en_cs_hybrid.ahk`

My custom keyboard layout that combines the default EN layout with Czech characters. This gets activated from the main script with `Alt` + `Shift`, similar to how you'd normally switch layouts.

Irreplacable for people like me who are used to the mainstream layout but live in Czech Republic ðŸ™ƒ

However, it can do some weird stuff to other hotkeys because it changes numbers to the CS characters, so enable it only when you need it.


## Scroll Wheel Acceleration `acc_scroll.ahk`

Makes scrolling way faster and easier. There's no going back.


## Mouse Acceleration `acc_mouse.ahk`

Similar to `acc_scroll.ahk` but for mouse movement. Low mouse movement remains the same, fast movement gets even faster. Somewhat unreliable though.
