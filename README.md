# AutoHotkey Scripts

My janky scripts for improved eFFiCieNcY. Made for v1.1.33, get AHK here - https://www.autohotkey.com/


## Main Script `ax_main.ahk`

This is the script that calls other sub-scripts and contains the most important hotkeys.

Some of the functionality:
- Easier tab navigation (Chrome, VS Code)
- Quick search on Google, Wolfram Alpha, YouTube, Spotify
- Â± 40 volume for switching between headphones and speakers
- Switches for Night light & Focus assist
- Hotkeys for AE, LaTeX, Python
- Hotstrings for `â‰¤`, `â‰¥`, `â‰ˆ`, `â‰ `, `Â±`
- Reloading Blender and copying folders for addon development
- Encoding current time to 5 characters and vice versa
- Etc.


## EN/CS Hybrid Keyboard Layout

My custom keyboard layout that combines the default EN layout with Czech characters. Indispensable for people like me who are used to the mainstream layout but live in Czech Republic. There is, however, a non zero chance it will do something weird to other hotkeys, so enable only when needed.

Default hotkey - `Alt`+`Shift`.


## Scroll Wheel Acceleration

Makes scrolling way faster and easier. There's no going back.


## Mouse Acceleration

Similar to the above but for mouse movement. Slow mouse movements remain the same, fast movements get even faster. Somewhat unreliable though, hence disabled by default.


## Measure Tool

For measuring distances on screen in pixels. The value gets automatically saved to clipboard. Default hotkey - `XButton1`+`M`.


## Colour Picker

Colour picker/checker that can "see" through Filmic in Blender. While running, `Ctrl`+`C` copies the data so you can paste it in any Blender colour input. Works only with Filmic + Medium Contrast (aka None). Default hotkey - `XButton1`+`C`.
